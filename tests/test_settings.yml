# CLUSTERING
# Existing thermal power plants are clusted to reduce the number of distinct plants.
# The existing method (for now) is to specify the number of clusters for each type
# of thermal plant as a default and then specify specific values for any regions
# that are different.

# Technologies that aren't listed here won't be included in the final cluster
# outputs, even if they are included in alt_clusters below.
