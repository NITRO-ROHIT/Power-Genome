# List the method to calculate total distributed generation in each region (not all
# regions need to be listed here). Both methods use a normalized profile in the file
# specified by "distributed_gen_profiles_fn". Values for each planning year/region
# should be included in the "distributed_gen_values" parameter.
# - "capacity": Use the capacity (MW) to scale up generation
# - "fraction_load": Distributed generation is a specific fraction of total load
distributed_gen_method: ~

# Values - either MW or fraction of load - matching the methods listed for each region
# in "distributed_gen_method". These can be varied by scenario by adding them to an
# associated scenario in "settings_management".
distributed_gen_values: ~

# Set this parameter to "true" if existing distributed generation in each region should
# be represented as a resource rather than being subtracted from demand.
dg_as_resource: ~

# Distribution loss used when subtracting distributed generation from total load.
